## UDP PINGER PROJECT

A Python-based project that simulates network communication using the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). The system sends and receives packets, measures round-trip time (RTT), and calculates packet loss to analyze network performance and reliability.

---

## Overview

The UDP Pinger project demonstrates how UDP works as a connectionless transport protocol. It includes both a client and a server that exchange packets to test network latency and reliability. The system can also simulate packet loss and delayed responses to mimic real-world network conditions.

## Features

- Implements UDP client and server communication  
- Measures round-trip time (RTT) for each packet  
- Calculates average delay and packet loss rate  
- Simulates packet loss and timeout scenarios  
- Helps visualize UDPâ€™s unreliable yet fast data transmission

## Technologies Used

- Python  
- Socket Programming  
- Networking Fundamentals

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/yourusername/UDP-Pinger.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
     cd <directory_name>

3. Run the server first:
     python udp_pinger_server.py

4. In another terminal, run the client:
     python udp_pinger_client.py
